#    VEB -- Virtual environment builder V_0.0000001
#    
#    Copyright (C) 2011 Michael Imelfort
#    
#    An alternative to openstack or other highly complex platforms
#    A little more advanced than simply running KVM on the command line

    This system is aimed at scientists (or other people) who need to maintain
    a cluster of VMs but can't ustify the time to be sysadmins

    If you've got a collection of servers and they're all set up to use KVM
    then you can use this build environment to manage the creation and allocation
    of VMs. You still need to bring things up and down using "virsh" but you
    can specify a bunch of machine templates and first boot scripts and then
    build as many of them as you like. Then instead of updating X servers, you
    can simply rebuild them and then redeploy!

Once you have unpacked everything you'll need to add thes lines to your ~/.bashrc

 export VEB_ROOT='path to "veb" folder'
 export PATH=$PATH:$VEB_ROOT/src

Then you need to start building templates! More on this coming soon...
